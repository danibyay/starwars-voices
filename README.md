# starwars-voices
This is a school project where we apply the Fourier Transform to a given recording and modify the frequency properties of the sound to get it to sound like the voices of some characters of star wars.


Use with Eclipse for quick start.
Else, rearrange everything to be in the same directory. (images and .java files)
